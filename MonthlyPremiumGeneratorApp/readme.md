Assumptions
------------
1. It has been assumed that a web form application needs to be created as per requirement. 

2. As per requirement, for any given individual the monthly premium is calculated using the below formula
Death Premium = (Death Cover amount * Occupation Rating Factor * Age) /1000 * 12

3. All input fields are mandatory. Errors show up in application only after selecting dropdown at the end to calculate and display premium.

4. Occupation Rating Factor is constant for each occupation and is hardcoded in the application.

Usage
------
To generate the monthly premium user needs to enter/select all the mandatory fields. On selecting occupation dropdown with appropriate occupation, the application calculates and displays the monthly premium on the screen. 

Roadmap
--------
This is just an initial simple working application. There are many areas of improvements in the application such as:
1. The UI features can be enhanced with more sophisticated controls.
2. The Occupation Rating Factor can be made dynamic instead of hardcoding in application.
3. Features(functions) can be decoupled to reduce dependency.
